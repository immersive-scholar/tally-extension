    <h4>Welcome to Tally!</h4>

    <div style="width: 800px; color:#ddd; margin 0 auto; text-align:left">
    <p>Finally! I've found you! My name is Tally and I need your help.</p>
    <p>Like you, I hang out here on the internet. Mainly I watch cat videos. </p>
    <p>But lately things have been getting weird. Advertising has taken over.</p>
    <p>These aren't just popup ads, they are behavioral trackers that use your data against you. </p>
    <p>They are everywhere and they surveil you to influence your purchasing decisions.</p>
    <p>You can't use the internet without being manipulated by them. </p>
    <p>What's more, Vilikon, the master tracker who controls the trackers, is growing more powerful.</p>
    <p>His trackers are becoming more aggressive. They want more of your data to try to influence not just what you purchase, but how you vote and what you care about. </p>
    <p>While youâ€™ve been browsing on your computer, Product Monsters have been watching you and taking your information.</p>

    <p>It's your job to stop the monsters from collecting your data!!!</p>
    <p>Before you start your journey to defeat Vilikon, we need to create your secret identity. Let's go to your profile page!</p>
